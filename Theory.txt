What is K-Means Algorithm?
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different
clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.



The algorithm works as follows:

-> Choose the number of clusters K that you want to form.

-> Initialize the K centroids randomly in the feature space.

-> Assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest (using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance).

-> Recalculate the centroid of each cluster as the mean of the data points assigned to it.

-> Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes or a maximum number of iterations is reached.






How to choose the value of "K number of clusters" in K-means Clustering?

The performance of the K-means clustering algorithm depends upon highly efficient clusters that it forms. But choosing the optimal number of clusters is a big task. There are some different ways to find the optimal number of clusters, but here we are discussing the most appropriate method to find the number of clusters or value of K. The method is given below:

Elbow Method:

    The Elbow method is one of the most popular ways to find the optimal number of clusters. This method uses the concept of WCSS value. WCSS stands for Within Cluster Sum of Squares, which defines the total variations within a cluster. The formula to calculate the value of WCSS (for 3 clusters) is given below:

WCSS= ∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2 +∑Pi in Cluster2distance(Pi C2)2+∑Pi in CLuster3 distance(Pi C3)2
In the above formula of WCSS,

∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2: It is the sum of the square of the distances between each data point and its centroid within a cluster1 and the same for the other two terms.

To measure the distance between data points and centroid, we can use any method such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.

To find the optimal value of clusters, the elbow method follows the below steps:

1. It executes the K-means clustering on a given dataset for different K values (ranges from 1-10).
2. For each value of K, calculates the WCSS value.
3. Plots a curve between calculated WCSS values and the number of clusters K.
4. The sharp point of bend or a point of the plot looks like an arm, then that point is considered as the best value of K.


K-means clustering algorithm can be used to perform user segmentation for Amazon, based on the customers' purchasing behavior. Here's how it could be done:

-> Collect the data: Gather data on the customers' purchase history, including the products they bought, the amount spent, the time of purchase, and other relevant factors.

-> Preprocess the data: The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or incorrect values and normalize the features.

-> Determine the number of clusters: Choose the number of clusters K based on some criteria, such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

-> Apply K-means clustering: Apply K-means clustering to the preprocessed data, using the chosen number of clusters K. This will result in K clusters of customers, where each customer belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

-> Analyze the results: Analyze the results to gain insights into customer behavior. For example, you could identify the most profitable customer segments, the most frequently purchased products, the most popular time of purchase, and other patterns.

-> Take action: Use the insights gained from the analysis to tailor marketing campaigns, promotions, and product offerings to the different customer segments identified by the K-means clustering algorithm.

In summary, K-means clustering can be a useful technique to segment Amazon customers based on their purchasing behavior, and help the company to better understand its customers and offer them a more personalized experience.
